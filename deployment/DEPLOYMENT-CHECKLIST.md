## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### ‚úÖ Service Status Checks
```bash

sudo systemctl status projectpulse
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Run comprehensive health check
./deployment/health-check.sh
```

### ‚úÖ Application Access Tests
- [ ] HTTP access: `http://localhost:7000`
- [ ] HTTPS access: `https://your-domain.com` (if SSL configured)
- [ ] Login with admin credentials
- [ ] Verify data import (check projects and milestones)
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work

### ‚úÖ Database Verification
```bash
# Check database tables
sudo -u postgres psql -d projectpulse -c "\dt"

# Check record counts
sudo -u postgres psql -d projectpulse -c "
SELECT 
  'projects' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM projects
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'milestones' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM milestones
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM users;
"
```

### ‚úÖ SSL Certificate Verification
```bash
# Check certificate details
./deployment/ssl-setup.sh verify

# Test SSL endpoint
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

### ‚úÖ Security Verification
- [ ] Default passwords changed
- [ ] File permissions are secure
- [ ] Firewall configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Security headers present in HTTP responses
- [ ] Database access restricted

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

### Service Management
```bash
# Start/stop/restart application
sudo systemctl start projectpulse
sudo systemctl stop projectpulse
sudo systemctl restart projectpulse

# View application logs
sudo journalctl -u projectpulse -f
sudo journalctl -u projectpulse --since "1 hour ago"

# Reload Nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Backup & Restore
```bash
# Create backup
sudo /usr/local/bin/projectpulse-backup

# List backups
ls -la /opt/backups/projectpulse/

# Restore database (example)
sudo -u postgres psql projectpulse < backup_file.sql
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Full health check
./deployment/health-check.sh

# Quick health check
./deployment/health-check.sh quick

# Service-specific checks
./deployment/health-check.sh services
./deployment/health-check.sh database
./deployment/health-check.sh ssl
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status projectpulse

# Check logs for errors
sudo journalctl -u projectpulse --since "10 minutes ago"

# Verify port availability
sudo lsof -i :7000
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL status
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Test database connection
sudo -u postgres psql -d projectpulse -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check database configuration
cat .env | grep DB_
```

### SSL Certificate Problems
```bash
# Check certificate files
ls -la /etc/nginx/ssl/

# Verify certificate
./deployment/ssl-setup.sh verify

# Regenerate self-signed certificate
./deployment/ssl-setup.sh self-signed pm.mod.gov.qa
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix application permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/projectpulse

# Fix upload directory permissions
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/projectpulse/uploads
sudo chmod 755 /opt/projectpulse/uploads
```
